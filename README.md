# Advanced Topics in Computer Science (high school)

This repository contains code written in my Advanced Topics in Computer Science class. We covered methods of machine learning using scikit-learn and Keras. For my final project (chess piece classification), I combined linear algebra and computer vision by using principal component analysis with convolutional neural networks to classify chess images.
